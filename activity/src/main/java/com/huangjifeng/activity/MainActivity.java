     * Called when the current {@link Window} of the activity gains or loses
     * focus.  This is the best indicator of whether this activity is visible
     * to the user.  The default implementation clears the key tracking
     * state, so should always be called.
     *
     * <p>Note that this provides information about global focus state, which
     * is managed independently of activity lifecycles.  As such, while focus
     * changes will generally have some relation to lifecycle changes (an
     * activity that is stopped will not generally get window focus), you
     * should not rely on any particular order between the callbacks here and
     * those in the other lifecycle methods such as {@link #onResume}.
     *
     * <p>As a general rule, however, a resumed activity will have window
     * focus...  unless it has displayed other dialogs or popups that take
     * input focus, in which case the activity itself will not have focus
     * when the other windows have it.  Likewise, the system may display
     * system-level windows (such as the status bar notification panel or
     * a system alert) which will temporarily take window input focus without
     * pausing the foreground activity.

     * 从onWindowFocusChanged被执行起，用户可以与应用进行交互了，而这之前，对用户的操作需要做一点限制。
     * 比如我们在做OTT项目时候,我们就是在这onWindowFocusChanged来获取主按键的具体位置和宽高的,
     * 而在其他标准生命周期的接口中调用都是获取不到的，比如在onResume，onStart中都获取不到信息。
     * 这个onWindowFocusChanged指的是这个Activity得到或者失去焦点的时候 就会call。。
     * 也就是说 如果你想要做一个Activity一加载完毕，就触发什么的话 完全可以用这个！！！
     *
     * 使用一个view的getWidth() getHeight() 方法来获取该view的宽和高，返回的值却为0。
     * 如果这个view的长宽很确定不为0的话，那很可能是你过早的调用这些方法，也就是说在这个view被加入
     * 到rootview之前你就调用了这些方法，返回的值自然为0.解决该问题的方法有很多，主要就是延后调用
     * 这些方法。可以试着在onWindowFocusChanged()里面调用这些方法,验证时可以获取到View的宽高的。

     * so that the state can be restored in {@link #onCreate} or
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState} (the {@link Bundle} populated by this method
     * will be passed to both).
     *
     * <p>This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
     * comes back some time in the future it can restore its state.  For example,
     * if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
     * A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
     * current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
     * returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored
     * via {@link #onCreate} or {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}.
     *
     * <p>Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as
     * {@link #onPause}, which is always called when an activity is being placed
     * in the background or on its way to destruction, or {@link #onStop} which
     * is called before destruction.  One example of when {@link #onPause} and
     * {@link #onStop} is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
     * from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call {@link #onSaveInstanceState}
     * on B because that particular instance will never be restored, so the
     * system avoids calling it.  An example when {@link #onPause} is called and
     * not {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is when activity B is launched in front of activity A:
     * the system may avoid calling {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on activity A if it isn't
     * killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
     * A will stay intact.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
     * state for you by calling {@link android.view.View#onSaveInstanceState()} on each
     * view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
     * focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}).  If you override this method to save additional
     * information not captured by each individual view, you will likely want to
     * call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
     * all of the state of each view yourself.
     *
     * <p>If called, this method will occur before {@link #onStop}.  There are
     * no guarantees about whether it will occur before or after {@link #onPause}.
     *
     * @param outState Bundle in which to place your saved state.
